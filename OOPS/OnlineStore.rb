# Online Store Using OOP Principles
# Create a class Product with name, price, and quantity attributes. Then:
# Create two subclasses ElectronicProduct (with a warranty_period) and ClothingProduct (with a size).
# Add methods to calculate the total price based on the quantity.
# Use polymorphism to apply a discount on all products. Electronic products get a 10% discount, and clothing products get a 5% discount.
# Demonstrate encapsulation by hiding the productâ€™s details from the user and only providing access to relevant methods.
